The application is designed to manage inventory, categories, and other store-related operations. It also supports a legacy connection to Microsoft Access for backward compatibility with earlier database versions. This project is developed as part of a BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) course requirement.",

The team successfully migrated the database from MS Access to SQL Server using JDBC, ensuring robust connectivity. To maintain code quality in a collaborative environment, we enforced the MVC pattern and strict Git workflows. Furthermore, the user interface underwent a complete overhaul; using Figma for prototyping, we transitioned from basic JOptionPane inputs to a fully interactive Java Swing interface, significantly enhancing usability and design consistency.",
